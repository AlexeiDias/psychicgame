## The Psychic Game is a leeter guessing game that we play against the computer. THe computer pics a letter from the alphabet. Than the user choses a letter. A if statement compares the two selection. If the user letter and the computer letter are the same. User wins. If the letter are different the user gets to pick another letter. If user picks a letter that has already been chosen, an alert is given to the user. User has 10 chances. Game is reset after avery win. If the user don't guess the right letter after 10 attemps, losses count go up and the game resets before start again. Have fun playing.
